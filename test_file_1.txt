The "Wood Wide Web" (Mycology)
Beneath almost every forest floor lies a complex network of mycorrhizal fungi that connects individual trees. Through this fungal grid, trees actually communicate: they share nutrients with struggling neighbors, send chemical warnings about insect attacks, and even recognize their own offspring. It turns out forests are less like a collection of individuals and more like a massive, organic social network.
