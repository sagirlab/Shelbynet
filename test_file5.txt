Time Dilation (Physics)
According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, time isn't a constant; it’s flexible. Because of Time Dilation, if you were to spend a year traveling at 99% the speed of light in space and then returned to Earth, you would find that decades had passed for your friends while you only aged one year. Gravity does this too—time actually moves slightly slower at the base of a skyscraper than at the penthouse.
