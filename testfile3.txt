Bioluminescent Waves (Marine Biology)
In certain parts of the ocean, a phenomenon called "Sea Sparkle" occurs when billions of microscopic dinoflagellates are disturbed by waves or movement. They emit a neon-blue glow through a chemical reaction involving a protein called luciferase. If you swim in it, your body leaves a glowing trail, making you look like a character straight out of Avatar.
