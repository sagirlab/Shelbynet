The Voynich Manuscript (Linguistics)
Dating back to the 15th century, the Voynich Manuscript is a hand-written book full of strange illustrations of plants that don't exist and astrological diagrams. The catch? It’s written in an entirely unknown script that has never been deciphered. Despite the best efforts of world-class codebreakers from WWI and WWII, and even modern AI, nobody knows if it's a sophisticated hoax, a scientific breakthrough, or an extinct language.
