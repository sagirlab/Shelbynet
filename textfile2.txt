In 1932, the Australian military literally declared war on emus. The birds were destroying crops in Western Australia, so soldiers were sent in with Lewis machine guns. The result? The emus won. The birds proved surprisingly resilient to bullets and excelled at guerrilla-style maneuvering. After several failed attempts and thousands of wasted rounds, the military withdrew, leaving the emus in command of the wheat fields.
